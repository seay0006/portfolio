# Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?

    During the structuring process of this assignment I found myself making steady pace compared to my previous work, however had i planned better I would have taken into account the addition of bootstraps and where i wanted to place them to begin with.

    I unfortunately went about it wrong and planned things backwards.

    I overcame the challenges through giving myself enough time to fix the mistakes I had made, if i didnt have the time management skills I would have found myself at a loss for progress.

  


# External Resources Used

## Bootstrap
    [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)



# Difficulties I faced

 ## Screen Sizing

    Nearing the end of my available time to do the assignment I found that I had brain fogged my way through the assignment. Beliving that 1440, was the standard monitor not 1920. This caused me stress and I believe I caught it just in time to fix the mistakes it caused.

    
## Linking the Nav bar

      Another difficulty I had was with the linking of the navbar links using bootstrap, following the website, youtube videos and more I still found myself having troubles having the links work going back to the main homepage.
